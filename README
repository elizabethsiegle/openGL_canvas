First CS312 homework assignment: Make a canvas in C with OpenGL that draws lines, triangles, rectangles, and circles of varying colors (based on keys pressed.) Use F1, F2, F3, and F4 to switch between shapes, and R, G, and B keys to switch colors. Q and ESC exit the canvas, and C clears it. If you don't click the mouse and just drag it, it uses line-stipple to show the cursor movements.
